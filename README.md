# probabilistic_drainage_network_evolution_model
This contains python codes for a probabilistic model developed for explaining statistical organization in river networks. Please refer research article to understand the model details and algorithm.  Article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309170822002056

The main_model code will generate river networks for square boundary and model_gen_bounadry will create network for any general boundary for which sample input files of Tasmania are given.
